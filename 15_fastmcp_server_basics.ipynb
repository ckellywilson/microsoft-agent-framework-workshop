    "- Model Context Protocol (MCP) overview\n",
    "- Creating a FastMCP server\n",
    "- Defining custom tools with schemas\n",
    "- Testing MCP servers locally\n",
    "- Integrating MCP servers with AI agents\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a standardized way for AI agents to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access external data (databases, APIs, file systems)\n",
    "- Execute functions and tools\n",
    "- Maintain context across interactions\n",
    "- Scale agent capabilities without modifying agent code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why FastMCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**FastMCP** is a Python framework that makes it easy to build MCP servers with:\n",
    "- Simple, decorator-based tool definitions\n",
    "- Automatic schema generation\n",
    "- Built-in validation\n",
    "- Easy local testing\n",
    "- Production-ready server implementation\n",

    "- Don't pin FastMCP versions - use `pip install fastmcp` without constraints\n",
    "- Let pip auto-resolve dependencies (FastMCP evolves rapidly)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Environment & Security**\n",
    "- Store credentials in Azure Keyvault\n",
    "- Validate environment variables before agent creation\n",
    "- Never hardcode sensitive values\n",

    "**4. Testing & Error Handling**\n",

    "- Test with agents to verify JSON serialization\n",
    "- Wrap tool functions in try-except blocks\n",
    "- Return structured error responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Production Considerations**\n",
    "- Make tools async for I/O operations\n",
