    "**Key Concepts:**\n",
    "- Model Context Protocol (MCP) overview\n",
    "- Creating a FastMCP server\n",
    "- Defining custom tools with schemas\n",
    "- Testing MCP servers locally\n",
    "- Integrating MCP servers with AI agents\n",

    "### What is MCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard for connecting AI assistants to external data sources and tools. Think of it as a standardized way for AI agents to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Access external data (databases, APIs, file systems)\n",
    "- Execute functions and tools\n",
    "- Maintain context across interactions\n",
    "- Scale agent capabilities without modifying agent code\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why FastMCP?\n",
    "\n",
    "**FastMCP** is a Python framework that makes it easy to build MCP servers with:\n",
    "- Simple, decorator-based tool definitions\n",
    "- Automatic schema generation\n",
    "- Built-in validation\n",
    "- Easy local testing\n",
    "- Production-ready server implementation\n",

    "\n",
    "### What We Just Built\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "# Tools are Python functions in the same process\n",
    "agent = chat_client.create_agent(\n",
    "    tools=[_search_flights, _check_hotel_availability, _convert_currency]\n",
    ")\n",

    "- Development and testing\n",
    "- Quick prototyping\n",
    "- Single-agent applications\n",
    "- Learning MCP concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What's Next: Hosted MCP Servers\n",
    "\n",
    "In **Tutorial 16**, you'll deploy this MCP server to Azure and use **HostedMCPTool**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Tools are hosted on a remote MCP server\n",
    "agent = chat_client.create_agent(\n",
    "    tools=HostedMCPTool(\n",

    "**1. Dual Function Pattern (Required for Agent Integration)**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Underscore functions return JSON-serializable dicts (for agents)\n",
    "def _search_flights(...) -> List[Dict]:\n",

    "def search_flights(...) -> List[Flight]:\n",
    "    return [Flight(**f) for f in _search_flights(...)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Package Management**\n",
    "- Don't pin FastMCP versions - use `pip install fastmcp` without constraints\n",
    "- Let pip auto-resolve dependencies (FastMCP evolves rapidly)\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Environment & Security**\n",
    "- Store credentials in `.env` files\n",
    "- Validate environment variables before agent creation\n",
    "- Never hardcode sensitive values\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Testing & Error Handling**\n",
    "- Test underscore functions locally first\n",
    "- Test with agents to verify JSON serialization\n",
    "- Wrap tool functions in try-except blocks\n",
    "- Return structured error responses\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Production Considerations**\n",
    "- Make tools async for I/O operations\n",
    "- Implement rate limiting and timeouts\n",
    "- Use caching for frequently requested data\n",
    "- Monitor tool invocations and error rates"
