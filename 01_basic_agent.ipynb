      "\n",
      "### **Clothing**\n",
      "- **Thermal base layers:** Pack moisture-wicking long-sleeve shirts and leggings; Merino wool is great!\n",
      "- **Warm sweaters:** Wool or fleece works well as mid-layers.\n",
      "- **Waterproof and windproof outerwear:** A good insulated jacket and waterproof pants are essential for staying dry and warm.\n",
      "- **Sturdy waterproof boots:** Snow and ice are common; boots with good grip are a must.\n",
      "- **Thick socks:** Wool socks keep feet warm and dry.\n",
      "- **Gloves/mittens:** Consider waterproof gloves for extra warmth.\n",
      "- **Warm hat:** Covers your ears!\n",
      "- **Scarf or neck gaiter:** Essential to protect against icy winds.\n",
      "- **Swimsuit:** For hot springs like the Blue Lagoon or local geothermal pools!\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Accessories**\n",
      "- **Sunglasses:** The snow reflects sunlight, which can be surprisingly bright.\n",
      "- **Reusable water bottle:** Tap water is fresh and safe.\n",
      "- **Power bank:** Essential since cold weather can drain batteries faster.\n",
      "- **Travel adapter:** Iceland uses the standard European plug (Type F).\n",
      "- **Camera:** For northern lights, waterfalls, and unique landscapes.\n",
      "- **Daypack:** Useful for day trips and excursions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Toiletries & Extras**\n",
      "- **Moisturizer & lip balm:** Cold, dry air can be tough on skin.\n",
      "- **Medications:** Especially anything you take regularly—access to certain meds may be limited.\n",
      "- **First aid kit:** Always good to have for any minor cuts/scrapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Special Considerations**\n",
      "- **Hand/foot warmers:** Great for long outdoor activities.\n",
      "- **Ice grips for boots:** Useful if you plan to walk in icy areas.\n",
      "- **Layers, layers, layers:** The key to comfort is wearing multiple layers you can adjust throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tip:** Weather changes quickly—always check the forecast, and pack an extra layer just in case!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you let me know your planned activities (Northern Lights chasing, glacier hikes, city sightseeing), I can tailor this list even more. Have a fantastic time—winter in Iceland is truly magical!\n"
