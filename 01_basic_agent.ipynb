    "- Create your first agent using Microsoft Agent Framework\n",
    "- Learn about chat clients and how to configure them with Azure OpenAI\n",
    "- Send queries to your agent and get responses\n",
    "- Understand agent instructions and how they guide behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this tutorial, ensure you have:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Python 3.11 or higher** installed\n",
    "2. **Azure subscription** with Azure OpenAI service enabled\n",
    "3. **Azure OpenAI deployment** created (gpt-4, gpt-4o, or gpt-35-turbo)\n",
    "4. **Virtual environment** set up (using venv or uv)\n",
    "5. **Dependencies installed** from requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "##  Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Using venv (Standard Python)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Create virtual environment\n",
    "python -m venv venv\n",
    "\n",
    "# Activate it\n",
    "source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux\n",
    "# OR\n",
    "venv\\Scripts\\activate  # Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install dependencies\n",
    "pip install -r requirements.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Using uv (Faster Alternative)\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install uv (if not already installed)\n",
    "curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create virtual environment and install dependencies\n",
    "uv venv\n",
    "source .venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux\n",
    "# OR\n",
    ".venv\\Scripts\\activate  # Windows\n",

    "### Environment Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a `.env` file in the project root with your Azure OpenAI credentials:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "**Where to find these values:**\n",
    "- Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)\n",
    "- Navigate to your Azure OpenAI resource\n",
    "- Click \"Keys and Endpoint\" to get your endpoint and API key\n",
    "- Go to Azure OpenAI Studio → Deployments to find your deployment name\n",

    "\n",
    "### What is an AI Agent?\n",
    "An AI agent uses an LLM (Large Language Model) to:\n",
    "1. **Process user inputs** - Understand what users are asking\n",
    "2. **Make decisions** - Determine the best way to respond\n",
    "3. **Generate responses** - Provide helpful, contextual answers\n",
    "\n",
    "### Components You'll Use\n",
    "- **`ChatAgent`** - The main agent class that handles conversations\n",
    "- **`AzureOpenAIChatClient`** - Connects your agent to Azure OpenAI models\n",
    "- **Instructions** - System prompts that define your agent's personality and expertise\n",

      "User: What should I pack for a winter trip to Iceland?\n",
      "\n",
      "Agent: How exciting—a winter trip to Iceland! Iceland’s winter weather can be unpredictable, with snow, wind, and chilly temperatures, but a little planning can make your adventure comfortable and magical. Here’s a detailed packing list to help you:\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Clothing**\n",
      "- **Thermal base layers:** Pack moisture-wicking long-sleeve shirts and leggings; Merino wool is great!\n",
      "- **Warm sweaters:** Wool or fleece works well as mid-layers.\n",
      "- **Waterproof and windproof outerwear:** A good insulated jacket and waterproof pants are essential for staying dry and warm.\n",
      "- **Sturdy waterproof boots:** Snow and ice are common; boots with good grip are a must.\n",
      "- **Thick socks:** Wool socks keep feet warm and dry.\n",
      "- **Gloves/mittens:** Consider waterproof gloves for extra warmth.\n",
      "- **Warm hat:** Covers your ears!\n",
      "- **Scarf or neck gaiter:** Essential to protect against icy winds.\n",
      "- **Swimsuit:** For hot springs like the Blue Lagoon or local geothermal pools!\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Accessories**\n",
      "- **Sunglasses:** The snow reflects sunlight, which can be surprisingly bright.\n",
      "- **Reusable water bottle:** Tap water is fresh and safe.\n",
      "- **Power bank:** Essential since cold weather can drain batteries faster.\n",
      "- **Travel adapter:** Iceland uses the standard European plug (Type F).\n",
      "- **Camera:** For northern lights, waterfalls, and unique landscapes.\n",
      "- **Daypack:** Useful for day trips and excursions.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Toiletries & Extras**\n",
      "- **Moisturizer & lip balm:** Cold, dry air can be tough on skin.\n",
      "- **Medications:** Especially anything you take regularly—access to certain meds may be limited.\n",
      "- **First aid kit:** Always good to have for any minor cuts/scrapes.\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Special Considerations**\n",
      "- **Hand/foot warmers:** Great for long outdoor activities.\n",
      "- **Ice grips for boots:** Useful if you plan to walk in icy areas.\n",
      "- **Layers, layers, layers:** The key to comfort is wearing multiple layers you can adjust throughout the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Tip:** Weather changes quickly—always check the forecast, and pack an extra layer just in case!\n",
      "\n",
      "If you let me know your planned activities (Northern Lights chasing, glacier hikes, city sightseeing), I can tailor this list even more. Have a fantastic time—winter in Iceland is truly magical!\n"

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. User Query → 2. ChatAgent → 3. AzureOpenAIChatClient → 4. Azure OpenAI API\n",
    "                                                               ↓\n",
    "8. Display ← 7. ChatAgent ← 6. AzureOpenAIChatClient ← 5. LLM Response\n",
    "```\n",

    "- The **instructions** guide how the agent responds to ALL queries\n",
    "- The **AzureOpenAIChatClient** handles all API communication automatically\n",
    "- The agent uses the LLM's knowledge up to its training cutoff date\n",
    "\n",
    "**What the Framework Does for You:**\n",
    "- ✅ Manages API authentication and requests\n",
    "- ✅ Handles token counting and limits\n",
    "- ✅ Formats messages in the correct structure\n",
    "- ✅ Retries on failures\n",

      "\n",
      "**1. Algarve, Portugal**  \n",
      "Golden cliffs, secret coves, and just laid-back vibes. Surfers, foodies, and sun-lovers all fit in here. Lagos is super fun, but there are quieter spots too!\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "**3. Amalfi Coast, Italy**  \n",
      "Okay, technically beaches are small (sometimes just pebbles), but the views? Unreal. Positano is pure Instagram goals. Try Sorrento for fewer crowds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. Costa Brava, Spain**  \n",
      "You get cliffside villages, turquoise bays, and some killer seafood. Tossa de Mar is a must for chill beach vibes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. French Riviera (Nice, Antibes, St. Tropez...)**  \n",
      "Glitz & glamour mixed with med beaches. More pricey but sometimes you just gotta splurge. Nice beaches are pebbly, but the water is 💙.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Croatia (Hvar, Dubrovnik, Split...)**  \n",
      "Adriatic Sea’s even warmer than the Med! Hvar is party central, but tiny islands like Vis feel like secret hideouts.\n",

    "## ✅ Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setup matters**: Proper environment configuration with venv/uv and `.env` files is essential\n",
    "2. **Azure OpenAI integration**: The `AzureOpenAIChatClient` handles all API communication\n",
    "3. **Creating agents is simple**: Just provide a chat client and instructions\n",
    "4. **Instructions are powerful**: They define personality, expertise, and behavior\n",
    "5. **Agents are stateless by default**: Each `run()` is independent (we'll fix this in Tutorial 03)\n",
    "6. **The framework abstracts complexity**: You don't deal with raw API calls, token management, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Current Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Our agent is basic and has limitations:\n",
    "- ❌ Can't call external APIs (weather, flights, etc.)\n",
    "- ❌ Doesn't remember previous messages in a conversation\n",
    "- ❌ Can't verify real-time information\n",
    "- ❌ Limited to the LLM's training data\n",
