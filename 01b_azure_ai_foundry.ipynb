    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand what Azure AI Foundry (formerly Azure AI Studio) is\n",
    "- Learn the differences between OpenAI and Azure AI Foundry agents\n",
    "- Create agents using Azure AI Foundry with enterprise features\n",
    "- Work with Azure authentication and credentials\n",
    "- Understand when to use Azure AI Foundry vs. direct OpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Azure AI Foundry?\n",
    "Azure AI Foundry is Microsoft's enterprise AI platform that provides:\n",
    "- **Managed AI Models** - Host and scale OpenAI and other models\n",
    "- **Enterprise Security** - VNET, RBAC, managed identities\n",
    "- **Built-in Tools** - Code interpreter, file search, Bing grounding\n",
    "- **Content Safety** - Automatic content filtering and safety checks\n",
    "- **Monitoring** - Built-in logging, metrics, and tracing\n",
    "- **Compliance** - Meet enterprise compliance requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "### OpenAI vs Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | OpenAI Direct | Azure AI Foundry |\n",
    "|---------|--------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Setup** | Simple API key | Azure subscription + project |\n",
    "| **Security** | API key only | Enterprise security (RBAC, VNET) |\n",
    "| **Tools** | Function calling | Functions + Code Interpreter + File Search + Bing |\n",
    "| **Monitoring** | External | Built-in Azure Monitor |\n",
    "| **Cost** | Pay-per-token | Pay-per-token + Azure overhead |\n",
    "| **Compliance** | Limited | Full Azure compliance |\n",
    "| **Best For** | Prototypes, startups | Enterprise, production |\n",
