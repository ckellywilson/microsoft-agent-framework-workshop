    "\n",
    "### Why Azure AD Instead of API Keys?\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **More Secure** - No secrets in code, tokens auto-rotate\n",
    "-  **RBAC Integration** - Fine-grained access control\n",
    "-  **Audit Trail** - Who accessed what and when\n",
    "-  **Managed Identity** - No credentials needed for Azure-hosted apps\n",
    "\n",
    "### Authentication Options:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **AzureCliCredential** ( Best for local development)\n",
    "   - Uses your `az login` session\n",
    "   - No configuration needed\n",
    "   - Recommended for this tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DefaultAzureCredential** ( Best for production)\n",
    "   - Tries multiple authentication methods in order\n",
    "   - Works in Azure, local development, and CI/CD\n",
    "   - Recommended for deployed applications\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ManagedIdentityCredential** ( Best for Azure-hosted apps)\n",
    "   - Uses Azure Managed Identity\n",
    "   - No secrets to manage at all!\n",

    "## 📊 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Azure AI Foundry:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Enterprise production workloads** - Need security, compliance, governance  \n",
    "✅ **Team collaboration** - Multiple developers sharing projects and resources  \n",
    "✅ **Advanced AI features** - Code interpreter, file search, Bing grounding  \n",
    "✅ **Content safety** - Automatic harmful content filtering  \n",
    "✅ **Full monitoring** - Azure Monitor integration with distributed tracing  \n",
    "✅ **Managed identities** - No secrets management needed  \n",
    "✅ **RBAC & VNET** - Fine-grained access control and network isolation\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Azure OpenAI Direct (Tutorial 01):\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Quick prototyping** - Faster setup with just endpoint + API key  \n",
    "✅ **Simple applications** - Don't need enterprise platform features  \n",
    "✅ **Learning** - Easier to understand fundamentals  \n",
    "✅ **Cost sensitivity** - No Azure AI Foundry project overhead  \n",
    "✅ **Maximum control** - Direct API access for custom scenarios\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Aspect | Azure OpenAI Direct | Azure AI Foundry |\n",
    "|--------|---------------------|------------------|\n",
    "| **Import** | `AzureOpenAIChatClient` | `AzureAIAgentClient` |\n",
    "| **Authentication** | API key (string) | Azure credential (object) |\n",
    "| **Setup Complexity** | Low (2 values) | Medium (Azure project) |\n",
    "| **Context Manager** | Optional | Recommended (`async with`) |\n",
    "| **Agent Lifecycle** | Manual | Automatic or persistent |\n",
    "| **Built-in Tools** | None (functions only) | Code interpreter, file search, Bing |\n",
    "| **Monitoring** | External needed | Built-in Azure Monitor |\n",
    "| **Cost** | Pay-per-token only | Pay-per-token + platform |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Development Best Practice:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Learn & Prototype** → Tutorial 01 (Azure OpenAI Direct)\n",
    "2. **Enterprise Deploy** → Tutorial 01b (Azure AI Foundry)\n",
    "3. **Choose based on needs** → Not one-size-fits-all!\n",
