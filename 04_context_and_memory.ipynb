    "# Tutorial 04: Context and Memory - Personalized Travel Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand the difference between threads (conversation history) and memory (user knowledge)\n",
    "- Create custom Context Providers to add persistent memory\n",
    "- Extract and store user preferences automatically\n",
    "- Build personalized agents that remember user details across sessions\n",
    "- Serialize and restore memory state\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Threads vs. Memory: What's the Difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Threads (from Tutorial 03):**\n",
    "- Store conversation history (\"I said X, you said Y\")\n",
    "- Temporary: Good for a single conversation session\n",
    "- Example: \"User asked about Paris, then asked about weather there\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Memory (this tutorial):**\n",
    "- Store facts about the user (\"User prefers beach vacations\")\n",
    "- Persistent: Survives across sessions and threads\n",
    "- Example: \"User's name is Sarah, budget-conscious, vegetarian\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Context Providers\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Context Provider** is a component that:\n",
    "1. **Listens** to conversations (via `invoked()` method)\n",
    "2. **Extracts** important information (user preferences, facts)\n",
    "3. **Provides context** before each AI call (via `invoking()` method)\n",
    "4. **Persists** across sessions (via `serialize()` method)\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CustomMemory(ContextProvider):\n",
    "    async def invoked(...):\n",
    "        # Called AFTER agent responds\n",
    "        # Extract info from conversation\n",
    "    \n",
    "    async def invoking(...):\n",
    "        # Called BEFORE agent responds\n",
    "        # Provide remembered context\n",

    "##  Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Threads ≠ Memory**\n",
    "   - Threads: Conversation history (temporary)\n",
    "   - Memory: User knowledge (persistent)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Context Providers**\n",
    "   - Listen to conversations (`invoked()`)\n",
    "   - Provide context (`invoking()`)\n",
    "   - Persist state (`serialize()`)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Personalization**\n",
    "   - Agents remember user across sessions\n",
    "   - Tailored recommendations based on preferences\n",
    "   - Evolving understanding over time\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Practical Patterns**\n",
    "   - Save memory to database\n",
    "   - Restore memory on session start\n",
    "   - Update memory as user shares more\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Pydantic Models** for structured memory\n",
    "2. **Serialize frequently** to avoid data loss\n",
    "3. **Validate extracted data** before storing\n",
    "4. **Combine with threads** for best results\n",
    "5. **Handle errors gracefully** in extraction\n",

    "3. **Memory decay** - Implement time-based memory relevance (older preferences matter less)\n",
