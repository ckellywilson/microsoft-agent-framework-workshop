    "\n",
    "**MagenticBuilder** uses an AI orchestrator to dynamically create and manage workflows:\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **You provide**: A set of available agents\n",
    "2. **AI orchestrator**: \n",
    "   - Analyzes the user's request\n",
    "   - Creates an execution plan\n",
    "   - Selects which agents to call\n",
    "   - Determines the order of execution\n",
    "   - Adapts the plan based on results\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use MagenticBuilder\n",
    "\n",
    " **Use when:**\n",
    "- Task requirements are complex and unpredictable\n",
    "- Optimal workflow isn't known ahead of time\n",
    "- Need adaptive planning based on intermediate results\n",
    "- Task involves open-ended problem-solving\n",
    "\n",
    " **Don't use when:**\n",
    "- Workflow is well-defined and predictable\n",
    "- Need guaranteed execution order\n",
    "- Performance is critical (AI planning adds overhead)\n",
    "- Simple sequential or parallel patterns suffice\n",

    "##  Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Custom Executors**\n",
    "   - Inherit from `Executor` and call `super().__init__(id=\"...\")`\n",
    "   - Use `@handler` with `WorkflowContext` type annotation\n",
    "   - Implement business logic before passing to agents\n",
    "   - Examples: Validation, transformation, routing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **WorkflowBuilder**\n",
    "   - Full control over workflow graph structure\n",
    "   - Supports fan-out, fan-in, conditional routing\n",
    "   - Best for well-defined, complex workflows\n",
    "   - Deterministic and debuggable\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MagenticBuilder**\n",
    "   - AI orchestrator manages execution dynamically\n",
    "   - Best for unpredictable, adaptive workflows\n",
    "   - Scales easily to many specialized agents\n",
    "   - Higher overhead but more flexible\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Choosing the Right Pattern**\n",
    "   - **Known workflow** → WorkflowBuilder\n",
    "   - **Unknown/adaptive** → MagenticBuilder\n",
    "   - **Simple sequential** → SequentialBuilder (Tutorial 06)\n",
    "   - **Simple parallel** → ConcurrentBuilder (Tutorial 06)\n",
