    "# Tutorial 06: Multi-Agent Workflows (Basics)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Use Agent Framework's **built-in workflow builders** for multi-agent coordination\n",
    "- Build **sequential workflows** with `SequentialBuilder` (agent chaining)\n",
    "- Build **concurrent workflows** with `ConcurrentBuilder` (parallel execution)\n",
    "- Understand when to use each basic workflow pattern\n",
    "- Learn the foundation for advanced patterns (covered in Tutorial 07)\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📚 Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Multi-Agent Systems?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Single Agent (Tutorials 1-5):**\n",
    "- ✅ Simple, one agent handles everything\n",
    "- ❌ Can become overloaded with too many responsibilities\n",
    "- ❌ No specialization or parallelization\n",
    "- Example: General-purpose assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-Agent Workflows:**\n",
    "- ✅ Multiple specialized agents working together\n",
    "- ✅ Each agent focuses on their domain expertise\n",
    "- ✅ Parallel execution for speed\n",
    "- ✅ Clear separation of concerns\n",
    "- Example: Flight expert + Hotel expert + Activities expert\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agent Framework Workflow Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "The Agent Framework provides **built-in workflow builders**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Patterns (This Tutorial):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`SequentialBuilder`** - Agents work in sequence (A → B → C)\n",
    "   - Shared conversation context flows through each agent\n",
    "   - Each agent builds on previous agent's output\n",
    "   - Use for: Review/refinement, multi-step tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`ConcurrentBuilder`** - Agents work in parallel (A, B, C simultaneously)\n",
    "   - Fan-out to all agents with same input\n",
    "   - Fan-in aggregates results from all agents\n",
    "   - Use for: Independent tasks, gathering multiple perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Patterns (Tutorial 07):**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`WorkflowBuilder`** - Custom DAG with executors and edges\n",
    "   - Full control over workflow graph\n",
    "   - Custom routing logic and conditions\n",
    "   - Use for: Complex business logic, conditional flows\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **`MagenticBuilder`** - AI-powered orchestration\n",
    "   - LLM creates and manages execution plan\n",
    "   - Dynamic agent selection and coordination\n",
    "   - Use for: Complex, unpredictable tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Framework Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Built-in coordination** - No manual orchestration code  \n",
    "✅ **Automatic aggregation** - Results combined automatically  \n",
    "✅ **Event streaming** - Track progress in real-time  \n",
    "✅ **Checkpointing** - Pause/resume long workflows  \n",
    "✅ **Visualization** - See workflow graphs  \n",
    "✅ **Production-ready** - Error handling, observability built-in\n",

    "   - Best for refinement, multi-step processes\n",
    "   - Simple `.participants([agents]).build()` API\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Concurrent Workflows**\n",
    "   - Agents work in parallel: A ∥ B ∥ C\n",
    "   - Automatic fan-out and aggregation\n",
    "   - Best for independent tasks, speed\n",
    "   - Results combined automatically\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Workflows Handle Complexity**\n",
    "   - Automatic coordination\n",
