    "# Tutorial 08: Human-in-the-Loop & Interactive Workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Implement **approval gates** that pause workflows for human review\n",
    "- Create **interactive executors** that request user input\n",
    "- Build **multi-turn conversations** with human feedback loops\n",
    "- Use **context variables** to track approval states\n",
    "- Implement **rejection handlers** for declined requests\n",
    "- Understand **when human oversight is critical** vs optional\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "Before starting this tutorial, you should have completed:\n",
    "- **Tutorial 06: Multi-Agent Workflows** (Sequential, Concurrent patterns)\n",
    "- **Tutorial 07: Advanced Workflows** (WorkflowBuilder, Custom Executors)\n",
    "\n",
    "##  What is Human-in-the-Loop?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)** workflows pause execution to get human input:\n",
    "-  **Approval Gates** - Human reviews and approves/rejects AI decisions\n",
    "-  **Interactive Feedback** - Human provides input to guide execution\n",
    "-  **Quality Control** - Human validates critical outputs\n",
    "-  **Policy Compliance** - Human ensures adherence to rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use HITL?\n",
    "\n",
    "| Scenario | Why HITL? |\n",
    "|----------|----------|\n",
    "| Financial transactions | Legal requirement for approval |\n",
    "| Content publication | Quality and brand safety |\n",
    "| Data deletion | Irreversible action |\n",
    "| Customer communications | Reputation risk |\n",
    "| Policy violations | Manual judgment needed |\n",
    "| High-value decisions | Cost/risk mitigation |\n",
    "\n",
    "### HITL Patterns in This Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Approval Gate Pattern** - Simple approve/reject decision\n",
    "2. **Interactive Refinement** - Multi-turn conversation with feedback\n",
    "3. **Conditional Approval** - Different paths based on decision\n",
    "4. **Budget-Based Approval** - Auto-approve under threshold, else require human\n",

    "##  Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Approval Gates**\n",
    "   - Use `input()` in executors to pause workflows\n",
    "   - Get human approval/rejection decisions\n",
    "   - Route workflow based on decision\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Interactive Refinement**\n",
    "   - Multi-turn conversations with feedback\n",
    "   - Maintain conversation history\n",
    "   - Iterate until approval or max iterations\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Conditional Branching**\n",
    "   - Different paths based on approval\n",
    "   - Share state across executors\n",
    "   - Handle rejection gracefully\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Smart Approval**\n",
    "   - Business logic determines approval path\n",
    "   - Auto-approve low-risk items\n",
    "   - Require human review for high-risk\n",
    "   - Balance efficiency with oversight\n",
    "\n",
    "### HITL Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Use HITL:**\n",
    "-  High-stakes decisions (financial, legal)\n",
    "-  Irreversible actions (delete, publish)\n",
    "-  Compliance requirements (approval policies)\n",
    "-  Quality control (brand safety)\n",
    "-  Edge cases AI can't handle\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to Skip HITL:**\n",
    "-  High-volume, low-risk tasks\n",
    "-  Well-defined, routine operations\n",
    "-  Real-time requirements\n",
    "-  Development/testing environments\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Patterns\n",

    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Content Publishing Pipeline**\n",
    "   - AI drafts content → Editor reviews → Publish if approved\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Customer Support Escalation**\n",
    "   - AI handles routine queries → Escalate complex to human → Human provides guidance\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Financial Approval Workflow**\n",
    "   - Auto-approve < $1000 → Manager approval $1000-$10k → Executive approval > $10k\n",
