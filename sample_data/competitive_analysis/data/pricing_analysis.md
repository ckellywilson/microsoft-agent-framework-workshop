## 5. Price-Feature Correlation

### **Tables**
- All have very similar features (symmetrical base, wood/HPL finish, power/no power, fixed height).
- **Price increases with size** (e.g., 48"x48" starts at $1,677.96; 60"x60" reaches $1,989.17).
- **Power ready** adds $20–$30 over similar non-powered models.
  - Example: 48"x48" no power ($1,677.96) vs. power ready ($1,706.45) = +$28.49.
- Features have a weak price correlation; main impact comes from dimensions, not feature count.

### **Pedestals**
- Both have similar features (configuration and wood interiors).
- **Price increases with number of box compartments** (box/file: $2,056 vs. box/box/box: $3,224).
- Stronger correlation between configuration complexity and price.

**Overall:**  
- **Tables:** Price driven by size, not feature count.  
- **Pedestals:** Price more sensitive to configuration/features.

## 6. Outlier Identification

- **Lowest Price:** $1,677.96 (Haworth 48"x48" table, no power)
- **Highest Price:** $3,224.00 (Knoll pedestal, 3-box configuration)
- **Outlier:** The $3,224.00 pedestal is a significant outlier—~63% higher than the median product price.
- All other products fall between $1,677.96 and $2,056.00 for base models.

---

## 7. Market Insights

- **Tables** form a tight price band ($1,678–$1,989), suggesting standardized product, competitive pricing or compressed margins.
- **Pedestals** have a wider price band, driven by configuration and brand premium.
- **Few truly budget offerings**; nearly all products are mid-to-upmarket.
- **Brand segmentation:** Knoll targets premium buyers; Haworth tables are positioned at institutional midmarket.
- *Minimal price-feature elasticity* for tables; feature differentiation (e.g., “power ready”) adds little incremental value.

---

## 8. Strategic Pricing Recommendations

- **For Tables (Haworth):**
  - Maintain tight price band, but consider minor premium for feature-rich or custom finishes (currently undervalued).
  - Potential for an “entry-level” product at ~$1,500 to attract budget-sensitive buyers, if margin allows.
  - Highlight “power ready” or other differentiators with marketing, as actual price jump is small but may be valued by buyers.
  - Consider incremental price increases for larger dimensions – buyers appear to accept $80-$120 increments for size.

- **For Pedestals (Knoll):**
  - Strengthen premium brand positioning with added services or unique finishes in the $2,500-$3,000+ band.
  - Consider offering a simplified, lower-priced model ($1,800–$2,000) to target cost-conscious bulk buyers and compete with tables’ high end.
  - Communicate clearly on feature value (e.g., storage configuration, cabinetry) to justify premium over tables.
  - Leverage the “outlier” pedestal as a flagship product, or bundle with other premium office solutions to justify price.

- **General Recommendations:**
  - Scrutinize competitor product offerings for unique features not currently provided, especially for cross-category upsell opportunities.
  - Use promotional pricing or bundles to convert mid-range buyers upward, particularly during institutional buying cycles.
  - Monitor market for any new low-cost entrants—current data shows vulnerability at the low end.
  - For all categories: Clearly communicate “value add” of incremental features, especially if cost impact is minimal.
