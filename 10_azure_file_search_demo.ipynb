    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Accomplished\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Proper Azure AI Agent Configuration**\n",
    "- Used `AZURE_AI_PROJECT_ENDPOINT` from environment\n",
    "- Created `AzureAIAgentClient` with correct endpoint parameter\n",
    "- Authenticated with Azure CLI credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Official File Search Pattern**\n",
    "- Upload files with `client.project_client.agents.files.upload_and_poll()`\n",
    "- Create vector stores with `client.project_client.agents.vector_stores.create_and_poll()`\n",
    "- Use `HostedFileSearchTool` with `HostedVectorStoreContent`\n",
    "- Query documents with natural language\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Best Practices**\n",
    "- Async context managers for cleanup\n",
    "- Proper error handling\n",
    "- Resource cleanup (delete vector stores and files)\n",
    "- Structured data extraction as JSON\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Add your PDF files to `./competitive_analysis/input/`\n",
    "2. Run the file search test (Step 5)\n",
    "3. Run full extraction (Step 6)\n",
    "4. Review extracted data in `./competitive_analysis/output/`\n",
