    "# Tutorial 05: Middleware and Filters - Production-Ready Safeguards\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand middleware vs filters in the Agent Framework\n",
    "- Implement content filtering for safety and compliance\n",
    "- Add logging and observability to your agents\n",
    "- Transform requests and responses in real-time\n",
    "- Build production-ready safety mechanisms\n",
    "- Handle rate limiting and error recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### Middleware vs Filters: What's the Difference?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Middleware:**\n",
    "- Wraps around the entire agent execution\n",
    "- Can modify requests before they reach the agent\n",
    "- Can transform responses after the agent responds\n",
    "- Example: Authentication, rate limiting, logging\n",
    "\n",
    "**Filters:**\n",
    "- Focus on content safety and compliance\n",
    "- Block harmful or inappropriate content\n",
    "- Example: Profanity filters, PII detection, content moderation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Concerns\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world agents need:\n",
    "1. **Safety**: Content filtering, harmful request blocking\n",
    "2. **Observability**: Logging, metrics, tracing\n",
    "3. **Reliability**: Error handling, retry logic, circuit breakers\n",
    "4. **Compliance**: Data privacy, audit trails\n",
    "5. **Performance**: Caching, rate limiting\n",

    "### Key Patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Early Termination**\n",
    "- Middleware can stop the pipeline early\n",
    "- Example: Rate limiter blocks excessive requests\n",
    "- Example: Content filter rejects inappropriate content\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Request Transformation**\n",
    "- Modify messages before they reach the agent\n",
    "- Example: PII masking replaces sensitive data\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Response Enhancement**\n",
    "- Transform agent responses before returning\n",
    "- Example: Add disclaimers and formatting\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Cross-Cutting Concerns**\n",
    "- Logging, monitoring, and observability\n",
    "- Applied consistently across all requests\n",
