    "# Tutorial 02: Agent with Tools - Adding Real-World Capabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand what tools are and why they're essential\n",
    "- Create Python functions that agents can call\n",
    "- Use type annotations and docstrings for tool definitions\n",
    "- Add tools to agents at creation time and runtime\n",
    "- See how agents decide when to use tools\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What are Tools?\n",
    "Tools are **Python functions** that agents can call to:\n",
    "- Get real-time information (weather, news, prices)\n",
    "- Perform calculations (currency conversion, distance)\n",
    "- Access external APIs (flights, hotels, restaurants)\n",
    "- Interact with databases or files\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function Calling Flow\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"What's the weather in Paris?\"\n",
    "  ↓\n",
    "Agent: \"I need to call the weather tool\"\n",

    "1. **Clear docstrings** - The agent uses these to understand when to call the tool\n",
    "2. **Type annotations** - Help the agent extract correct parameters\n",
    "3. **Field descriptions** - Provide examples and context\n",
    "4. **Error handling** - Return helpful messages instead of crashing\n",
    "5. **Consistent returns** - Always return strings (or use structured output)\n",
    "6. **Descriptive names** - Function names should clearly indicate purpose\n",
