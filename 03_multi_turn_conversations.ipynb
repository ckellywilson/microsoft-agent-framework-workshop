    "# Tutorial 03: Multi-Turn Conversations - Stateful Travel Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, you will:\n",
    "- Understand what threads are and why they're essential\n",
    "- Create stateful conversations that remember context\n",
    "- Manage conversation threads with Azure AI\n",
    "- Build natural, flowing dialogues with your travel assistant\n",
    "- Learn when to create new threads vs. reusing existing ones\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is a Thread?\n",
    "A **thread** is a conversation history that maintains context across multiple queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Without threads:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"I want to visit Japan\"\n",
    "Agent: \"Great! Japan has many attractions...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"What's the weather there?\"\n",
    "Agent: \"Where would you like weather info?\"  Forgot Japan!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**With threads:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "User: \"I want to visit Japan\"\n",
    "Agent: \"Great! Japan has many attractions...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "User: \"What's the weather there?\"\n",
    "Agent: \"Let me check the weather in Japan...\"  Remembers!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread Types\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Automatic Threads** (stateless)\n",
    "   - New thread created for each `run()` call\n",
    "   - No memory between queries\n",
    "   - Good for: One-off questions\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Persistent Threads** (stateful)\n",
    "   - Same thread reused across multiple calls\n",
    "   - Maintains full conversation history\n",
    "   - Good for: Multi-turn conversations\n",

    "## 🗑 Agent Lifecycle Management in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automatic Agent Cleanup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important:** In Azure AI Foundry, **agents are automatically deleted** after execution completes. This is a key architectural difference from other platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "async with (\n",
    "    AzureCliCredential() as credential,\n",
    "    ChatAgent(\n",
    "        chat_client=AzureAIAgentClient(async_credential=credential),\n",
    "        name=\"TravelAgent\",\n",
    "        instructions=\"You are a travel assistant.\",\n",
    "    ) as agent,  # ← Agent is created here\n",
    "):\n",
    "    # Agent exists in Azure during this block\n",
    "    response = await agent.run(\"Hello\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "# ← Agent is DELETED from Azure here (when context exits)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens:**\n",
    "1. **Agent Created** - When entering the `async with` block, agent is created in Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "2. **Agent Used** - You can run queries, create threads, use tools\n",
    "3. **Agent Deleted** - When exiting the block, agent definition is removed from Azure\n",
    "4. **Threads Persist** - Thread data remains in Azure (only agent definition is deleted)\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Gets Deleted vs. What Persists\n",
    "\n",
    "| Resource | After Context Exit | Why |\n",
    "|----------|-------------------|-----|\n",
    "| **Agent Definition** |  Deleted | Reduces clutter, saves costs |\n",
    "| **Agent Name** |  Deleted | Agent resource is removed |\n",
    "| **Agent Instructions** |  Deleted | Part of agent definition |\n",
    "| **Agent Tools** |  Deleted | Part of agent definition |\n",
    "| **Thread ID** |  Persists | Conversation history preserved |\n",
    "| **Thread Messages** |  Persists | Your data is kept |\n",
    "| **Model Deployment** |  Persists | Shared resource |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages of Automatic Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Cost Efficiency** \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Traditional approach (agent persists)\n",
    "agent_id = \"agent-123\"  # Agent remains in Azure, costs accumulate\n",
    "# You pay for agent storage even when not using it\n",
    "\n",
    "# Azure AI Foundry approach (ephemeral agents)\n",
    "async with ChatAgent(...) as agent:\n",
    "    # Agent exists only when needed\n",
    "    await agent.run(query)\n",
    "# Agent deleted, no ongoing costs for unused agents\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit:** Pay only for compute during execution, not for idle agent storage\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Resource Management** 🧹\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Problem with persistent agents:\n",
    "# - Accumulation of old/test agents\n",
    "# - Namespace pollution\n",
    "# - Manual cleanup required\n",
    "\n",
    "# Azure AI Foundry solution:\n",
    "async with ChatAgent(name=\"TestAgent\") as agent:\n",
    "    # Create and test\n",
    "    pass\n",
    "# Auto-cleanup - no leftover test agents!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit:** No \"agent sprawl\" - your Azure workspace stays clean\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Security & Compliance** 🔒\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sensitive agent with PII access\n",
    "async with ChatAgent(\n",
    "    name=\"CustomerDataAgent\",\n",
    "    instructions=\"Access customer PII for support\"\n",
    ") as agent:\n",
    "    # Agent exists briefly\n",
    "    response = await agent.run(\"Get user info\")\n",
    "# Agent definition deleted, reduces attack surface\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit:** Shorter-lived credentials, reduced security risk\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Version Control & GitOps** \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Agent definition in your code\n",
    "async with ChatAgent(\n",
    "    name=\"V2TravelAgent\",  # Version in code\n",
    "    instructions=\"Updated instructions...\"  # Source controlled\n",
    ") as agent:\n",
    "    await agent.run(query)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benefit:** Agent behavior is code-defined, not state in Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "### Disadvantages & Tradeoffs\n",
    "\n",
    "| Disadvantage | Mitigation |\n",
    "|--------------|------------|\n",
    "| **Agent recreated each run** | Minimal overhead (~100-300ms) |\n",
    "| **Can't view agents in portal** | View threads/messages instead |\n",
    "| **Requires code to define** | Better for version control |\n",
    "| **No long-running agents** | Use threads for continuity |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Alternative: Persistent Agents (Other Platforms)\n",
    "\n",
    "Some platforms keep agents persistent:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Hypothetical persistent agent approach\n",
    "agent = create_agent(name=\"MyAgent\")  # Agent stays in platform\n",
    "agent_id = agent.id  # \"agent-abc123\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Later (different session)\n",
    "agent = get_agent(agent_id)  # Retrieve existing agent\n",
    "response = agent.run(\"Hello\")  # Use persistent agent\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**When persistent agents make sense:**\n",
    "- Agents with complex, evolving instructions\n",
    "- Shared agents across multiple services\n",
    "- Agents that learn/adapt over time\n",
    "- Long-running background agents\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Foundry's philosophy:**\n",
    "- Agents are **code** (in your repository)\n",
    "- Threads are **data** (in Azure)\n",
    "- Separates compute (ephemeral) from state (persistent)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Azure AI Foundry\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Define Agents as Code**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Good: Agent configuration in code\n",
    "def create_travel_agent(credential):\n",
    "    return ChatAgent(\n",
    "        chat_client=AzureAIAgentClient(async_credential=credential),\n",
    "        name=\"TravelAgent\",\n",
    "        instructions=\"You are a helpful travel assistant...\",\n",
    "        tools=[get_weather, get_attractions]\n",
    "    )\n",
    "\n",
    "# Use it\n",
    "async with create_travel_agent(credential) as agent:\n",
    "    response = await agent.run(query, thread=thread)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Persist Thread IDs, Not Agent IDs**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Save to database\n",
    "session_data = {\n",
    "    \"user_id\": user.id,\n",
    "    \"thread_id\": thread.service_thread_id,  #  Save this\n",
    "    # \"agent_id\": agent.id  #  Don't do this (agent will be deleted)\n",
    "}\n",
    "\n",
    "# Restore later\n",
    "async with create_travel_agent(credential) as agent:  # New agent\n",
    "    thread = AgentThread(service_thread_id=session_data[\"thread_id\"])  # Same thread\n",
    "    response = await agent.run(query, thread=thread)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Use Context Managers**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#  Good: Automatic cleanup\n",
    "async with ChatAgent(...) as agent:\n",
    "    await agent.run(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "#  Avoid: Manual management\n",
    "agent = ChatAgent(...)\n",
    "await agent.run(query)\n",
    "# Agent might not be cleaned up properly\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "##  Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### Thread Benefits\n",
    "1. **Context Awareness** - Agent remembers previous exchanges\n",
    "2. **Natural Conversations** - Users don't need to repeat information\n",
    "3. **Better UX** - Feels like talking to a human\n",
    "4. **Stateful Interactions** - Build on previous responses\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices\n",
    "1. **Use threads for conversations** - Always use them for multi-turn dialogues\n",
